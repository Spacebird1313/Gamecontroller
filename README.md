# Gamecontroller

The Gamecontroller is an embedded programmable controller board. The GAMECON V1.2 is a PCB designed and build by Professor Paillet Eric of the University of Antwerp. The GAMECON V1.2 is equiped with a Atmel XMEGA microcontroller to control several IO-components like LEDs, encoder, accelerometer, cursorstick and buzzer.

The Gamecontroller will be used to controller a basic game on a softcore processor on the ATLYS FPGA board with the serial port.

The project is divided in small assignments to create the drivers for the different components on the PCB.
